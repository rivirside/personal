# Radio Operations

## Objective and Purpose

Get General and Extra class licenses. Build practical radio skills for emergency communications.

Radio is a force multiplier for emergency response and disaster relief. When cell towers fail and internet goes down, radio keeps working. I need these skills for search and rescue operations, disaster response, and remote medical missions. Plus, understanding RF propagation and antenna theory ties directly into the electrical engineering fundamentals I'm studying.

## Current Status

**Profiles:** [World Radio League](https://app.worldradioleague.com/profile/KR4FWW?tab=Logbook)

**Licensed**: Technician Class (KR4FWW) - Expires August 2035

Working toward General class. Using HamStudy.org for structured practice questions and Tait Radio Academy for professional-grade technical knowledge. The goal is General by end of 2025, Extra by 2026.

## Roadmap

### Licenses
1. **Technician** Completed
2. **General** - In progress
   - Focus on HF propagation and operating procedures
   - Target: December 2025
3. **Extra** - Planned
   - Advanced theory and full privileges
   - Target: 2026
 4. VE Certification
   - Target: 2026


## Resources

### Primary Study Tools
**HamStudy.org** - Question pools with spaced repetition. The explanations actually teach the why, not just memorization.

**Tait Radio Academy** - Professional two-way radio training. Goes deeper than amateur radio into commercial systems.

### YouTube Channels
**Ham Radio Crash Course** - Josh's practical approach to everything amateur radio

**Dave Casler KE0OG** - Clear explanations of complex topics, especially for General and Extra

**K6UDA Radio** - Equipment reviews and operating tips

**Andreas Spiess** - The guy with the Swiss accent. Deep dives into LoRa and digital modes

**Tech Minds** - Digital modes and SDR focus

## Equipment

### Current Setup
**Yaesu FT-60R** - Bulletproof HT with Nagoya NA-771 whip and stock rubber duck. This thing is a tank.

**QRZ-1** - Budget HT for experiments. Running it with stock antenna, another NA-771, and hands-free setup for mobile ops.


## Practice

Hoping to make my first ISS contact around New Year's - nothing beats talking to astronauts overhead. 

Weekly nets on local repeaters. Building a portable go-kit for field operations. Learning Winlink for emergency email over radio.

The real learning happens on the air. Theory is important, but nothing beats actual operating experience.

## Giving Back

After Extra, I'm getting VE certified to help others get licensed. The amateur radio community gave me so much support starting out - time to pay it forward. Running exam sessions combines teaching, community service, and keeping the hobby alive for the next generation.

# Projects & Opportunities

Here's a list of projects and opportunities I'm considering along with the reasons I'm considering them. There's too many directions to take this hobby, and while I want to build up my skillset it also should be in an efficient manner to ensure the highest impact on my career and personal fulfillment.

### ISS Contact

This seems to be one of the first projects I can hit with my equipment, and it was in no short order a big factor in the selection of my equipment. I don't know exactly what to expect in terms of contact, but I've watched several videos on youtube and I can tell that it will be fulfilling to get to make contact with an astronaut aboard the ISS. Hopefully around a holiday and I can send them my well wishes! I will probably attempt this on HT and if that doesn't work I will reevaluate options.

### DIY Tape Measure Yagi Antenna

For satellite work and fox hunting

### DIY J-Pole Antenna

Better coverage from home QTH

### DIY Altoids Tin Beacon

Tiny QRP transmitter for APRS or CW

### ARES/RACES

Given my global health studies and interest in technical operations, I believe getting involved with local ARES/RACES groups and gaining experience during sims and practice could be an incredible opportunity to take this hobby in a more professional direction and apply it in an impactful way. 

### Skills Development & Planning
- **Emergency Communications** - ARES/RACES protocols
- **Digital Modes** - Packet, APRS, Winlink
- **Weak Signal Work** - FT8, meteor scatter, EME
- **Technical Building** - Antennas, QRP rigs, repeaters
- **EMergency Comms** - Get involved with local ARES/RACES sims and group connections. 


## Current Equipment

Radios: Yaesu FT-60R VHF/UHF HT, Explorer QRZ1 VHF/UHF HT
Antennas: SignalStuff SignalStick, Nagoya YA-771, Rubber Ducks
