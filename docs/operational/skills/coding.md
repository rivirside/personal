# Coding

## My Programming Journey

I came to programming through an unconventional path - not through computer science courses, but through a desire to solve real problems I encountered in medicine and research. My coding journey has been driven by necessity and curiosity, leading me to become proficient in several languages that each serve different purposes in my work.

## Swift - Where I Found My Stride

Swift has become my primary language, and I'm proud to have achieved a **LinkedIn Top 5% ranking** on their skill assessment. But more than the recognition, Swift represents where I've been able to combine my medical background with technology most effectively.

I created **Trialr**, an iOS app born from personal experience. My family and I have relied on clinical trials to access treatments that weren't otherwise available, and I realized how difficult it was to find and connect with these trials. Trialr helps users search, save, and contact clinical trials near them - turning a personal frustration into a solution for others.

I'm also a cofounder of **Penny Finance**, where we built a fintech app that uses on-device machine learning to provide financial insights while maintaining user privacy. This project taught me the importance of building technology that respects user data while still delivering powerful features.

Beyond building apps, I've become an active educator in the Swift community. I write tutorials on **Data Science in Swift** on GitHub and Medium (@oceanexplains), including my Swift Safari series that explores building data science tools from scratch. I believe in not just using tools, but understanding how they work under the hood.

My Swift toolkit includes:
- SwiftUI and UIKit for interface design
- CoreML and CreateML for machine learning
- HealthKit for health data integration
- CoreData with CloudKit for data persistence
- Contributing to open-source projects like BioSwift

## Python - The Swiss Army Knife

Python is my go-to for data science and research work. During my consulting role at Sanaby Health SPAC, I developed machine learning-based evaluation tools for ranking potential acquisition targets. This involved heavy use of **Pandas** for financial data manipulation, and **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for creating visualizations that could communicate complex analyses to executives.

My Python work spans several domains:

In **bioinformatics**, I've developed novel ML tools for protein analysis, working with ProteinDataBank files and UniProt data to train custom models. I've even experimented with de novo protein sequence generation from text inputs - essentially teaching computers to "write" proteins based on descriptions.

I'm proficient with the **HuggingFace** ecosystem, using transformer models like BioGPT, ProtGPT, SciBERT, and ProtBERT for various biological and scientific text processing tasks. I've implemented advanced techniques like parallelization, cycle-consistency learning, and contrastive learning methods.

For biological data handling, **Biopython** has been invaluable, and I've deployed several web applications using **Streamlit** when I need to quickly share tools with collaborators. I also use **spaCy** for natural language processing tasks, particularly when analyzing scientific literature.

## MATLAB - The Scientific Computing Foundation

I completed formal MATLAB training through EdX courses from both MathWorks and HarvardX. While not my daily driver, MATLAB taught me to think about data in matrices and gave me a solid foundation in scientific computing. I use it for:
- Processing various data formats from lab equipment
- Creating publication-quality visualizations
- Biological and medical data analysis
- Optimizing computational workflows

The skills I learned in MATLAB - thinking in terms of array operations and vectorized computing - have made me a better programmer in other languages too.

## Hardware Programming - Arduino and Raspberry Pi

My interest in hardware came from wanting to build custom lab equipment and sensors. With **Arduino and C++**, I've learned the basics of microcontroller programming, GPIO interaction, and sensor integration. I can prototype circuits on breadboards and have basic soldering skills - enough to build what I need.

**Linux and Raspberry Pi** opened up a different world of possibilities. I've built several projects that required sensor and motor control, all managed through the command line. There's something satisfying about SSHing into a headless Pi and getting hardware to respond to your commands.

## The Tools of the Trade

Beyond languages, I've become comfortable with the ecosystem of modern development:
- **Git/GitHub** for version control (essential for any project)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for exploratory data science
- **Xcode** for iOS development
- **VS Code** for everything else
- Cloud platforms like **Firebase** for backend services
- **Docker** for reproducible environments

## My Approach to Code

I believe code should tell a story. When I write, I'm not just instructing a computer - I'm communicating with future developers (including future me). Clean, readable code with good documentation isn't just nice to have; it's essential for scientific reproducibility and collaborative work.

My background in medicine has taught me the importance of systematic thinking and attention to detail. Just as a small error in medication dosing can have serious consequences, a small bug in code can invalidate months of research or mislead clinical decisions. This drives me to write careful, tested code.

I'm passionate about open-source contribution because I've benefited enormously from the community's shared knowledge. Whether it's contributing to BioSwift or publishing tutorials, I believe in giving back to the ecosystem that has given me so much.

## What's Next

I'm always learning. The field moves fast, and there's always a new tool or technique that could solve problems more elegantly. But I've learned that mastery comes not from knowing every language, but from deeply understanding the ones that matter for your work and being able to apply them creatively to solve real problems.

For me, coding isn't about the technology itself - it's about what that technology enables. Whether it's helping patients find clinical trials, analyzing protein structures, or building tools for financial literacy, code is simply the medium through which I can make an impact.
