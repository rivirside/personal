# Service Profile

## Philosophy of Service

Service has been a constant thread throughout my journey to medicine. For me, serving others isn't just about giving back - it's about understanding the diverse experiences and challenges that shape our communities. Each volunteer experience has taught me something essential about humanity, resilience, and the role of healthcare in addressing broader social needs.

## Areas of Focus

My service work has centered around several key populations:

### Disability Advocacy & Inclusion
Through organizations like GET Included Cafe, Noah's Angels, and Different Brains, I've worked to support individuals with disabilities and promote neurodiversity acceptance. These experiences have shown me how healthcare intersects with social inclusion, employment, education, and quality of life.

### Veteran Care
Volunteering at the VA Hospital in Philadelphia has given me profound respect for those who've served our country and insight into the unique healthcare challenges veterans face. This experience directly influenced my interest in serving underserved populations as a physician.

### Emergency Response
My involvement in emergency communications and search and rescue operations reflects my belief that medical professionals have a responsibility to serve during crises, using our skills when communities need them most.

## Impact on My Medical Journey

These service experiences haven't just complemented my medical education - they've fundamentally shaped it. They've taught me to see patients as whole people within their communities, to recognize healthcare disparities firsthand, and to understand that healing extends far beyond clinical interventions.

Working with individuals with disabilities has made me a stronger advocate for accessibility in medicine. Serving veterans has deepened my understanding of trauma-informed care. Emergency response work has prepared me to stay calm and effective under pressure.

## Current & Future Service
