## Memorable Experiences

Every shift at GET Included brought moments of joy and inspiration. I watched employees who initially struggled with social anxiety become confident baristas, greeting regular customers by name and recommending their favorite drinks. One employee, who had been told he'd never work independently, became our best sandwich maker - his attention to detail was unmatched.

The transformation wasn't just in the employees - it was in the community too. Regular customers would specifically come during certain shifts to see their favorite baristas. Parents would bring their children to show them that disability doesn't define capability. The cafe became more than a business; it became a beacon of inclusion.

## Reflection

GET Included Cafe showed me that inclusion isn't charity - it's justice. The employees there aren't inspirational because they have disabilities; they're inspirational because they show up every day, work hard, and refuse to let others' limitations define them.

This experience taught me that as a physician, my role extends beyond treating medical conditions. It includes advocating for my patients' full participation in society, recognizing their complete humanity, and fighting for a world where everyone has the opportunity to contribute their unique gifts.

Every latte served, every sandwich made, every customer greeted with a smile was a small revolution against low expectations. Being part of that revolution has forever changed how I see disability, inclusion, and the role of healthcare in creating equitable communities.
