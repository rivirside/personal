## Memorable Experiences

The respite events revealed the profound impact of providing families with even a few hours of support. I remember one single mother who broke down in tears when dropping off her son - it was the first time in months she could run errands without worry. She used those precious hours to attend a job interview that she'd been postponing because she had no childcare.

During one event, I worked one-on-one with a child who was initially completely withdrawn. Through patient engagement with sensory activities, he gradually opened up, and by the end was laughing and playing with other children. His mother later told me it was the first time she'd seen him comfortable in a group setting.

The annual fundraising gala was equally moving. Seeing the community come together - families we served alongside donors and supporters - demonstrated that inclusion isn't charity but community building. One major donor shared that watching the children play during a respite event convinced them to support the organization because they saw the immediate, tangible impact.

## Impact on Medical Journey

GET Included Cafe taught me about the broader ecosystem of care that families with disabled children navigate. The respite events weren't just about childcare - they were about recognizing that parent wellbeing directly affects child outcomes. Parents who are burned out, overwhelmed, and isolated cannot provide optimal care, no matter how much they love their children.

This experience showed me that healthcare extends beyond the clinic. Many families couldn't attend medical appointments because they had no one to watch their other children. Some parents delayed their own healthcare because they couldn't leave their disabled child. These respite events were, in many ways, preventive healthcare for entire families.

## Lessons Learned

### About Inclusion
- True inclusion means presuming competence
- Everyone deserves the dignity of meaningful work
- Accommodations level the playing field, they don't provide unfair advantages
- Community acceptance is powerful medicine

### About Healthcare
- Employment is a social determinant of health
- Self-worth and purpose directly impact wellbeing
- Healthcare providers must consider the whole person, including their aspirations
- Advocacy is an essential part of healthcare

### About Humanity
- Disability is just one aspect of human diversity
- Joy and pride in work are universal human needs
- Small acts of inclusion create ripple effects
- Everyone has something valuable to contribute

## Connection to Current Path

This experience directly informs my approach to medicine:
- Commitment to making healthcare accessible for all abilities

## Continuing Impact

The lessons from GET Included Cafe continue to influence my daily life:
- I actively promote inclusion in all spaces I enter
- I challenge myself and others to examine unconscious biases
- I advocate for accessibility in my medical school
- I seek out opportunities to support disability rights initiatives

## Reflection

GET Included Cafe showed me that supporting families with disabled children requires understanding their full context - not just the child's diagnosis but the family's resources, struggles, and needs. The respite events we organized weren't just nice extras; for many families, they were lifelines that allowed parents to work, attend to their own health, or simply rest.

The fundraising work taught me about sustainable support systems. It's not enough to provide services; we must build communities that understand and value inclusion. Seeing donors connect with families, understanding that their contributions provided tangible relief and support, showed me how healthcare and community support must work together.

This experience reinforced that as a future physician, I must consider not just my patients but their caregivers. A child with disabilities affects the entire family's health and wellbeing. By supporting parents through respite, resources, and understanding, we improve outcomes for everyone. GET Included Cafe taught me that true healthcare is holistic, community-based, and recognizes that sometimes the best medicine is a few hours of rest for an exhausted parent.
