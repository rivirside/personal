# Different Brains

## Organization Overview

Different Brains is a neurodiversity advocacy organization dedicated to increasing awareness, acceptance, and support for individuals with neurological differences. Through multimedia content, research initiatives, educational programs, and community outreach, Different Brains works to create a more inclusive society where all types of minds are valued and supported. The organization covers the full spectrum of neurodiversity including autism, ADHD, dyslexia, intellectual disabilities, mental health conditions, and acquired brain injuries.

## Dual Role: Service & Research

What made Different Brains unique was the opportunity to combine direct service with meaningful research. I wasn't just volunteering - I was contributing to the knowledge base that helps society better understand and support neurodiversity. This dual role taught me how research and advocacy can work hand-in-hand to create real change.

The research component involved:
- Systematic reviews of neurodiversity literature
- Analysis of workplace inclusion programs
- Evaluation of educational interventions
- Assessment of healthcare accessibility for neurodiverse populations
- Investigation of stigma reduction strategies
- **Co-leading a major research study**: "The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health, Physical Health, and Media Use of College Students With ADHD" (see [full project details](docs/academic/projects/covid-adhd-study.md))

## Population Served

Different Brains serves a diverse community including:
- Individuals with autism spectrum disorder
- People with ADHD and learning differences
- Those with intellectual and developmental disabilities
- Individuals with mental health conditions
- People with acquired brain injuries
- Families, educators, and employers seeking to support neurodiverse individuals

## Memorable Experiences

Working with Different Brains opened my eyes to the incredible diversity of human cognition. I met brilliant individuals whose minds work differently - entrepreneurs with ADHD who credit their success to their "divergent" thinking, artists with autism whose unique perspective creates breathtaking work, and advocates with learning disabilities fighting for educational reform.

One project that particularly impacted me was creating employment resources. We interviewed neurodiverse professionals thriving in their careers, showing that with the right support and understanding, neurological differences can be strengths. Their stories challenged everything I thought I knew about "disability" and "normal."

The research side revealed systemic barriers I hadn't fully appreciated - from healthcare providers lacking training in neurodiversity to educational systems that punish rather than accommodate different learning styles. This motivated me to be part of the solution.

## Skills Developed

### Research Skills
- Literature review and synthesis
- Data analysis and interpretation
- Research translation for public audiences
- Evidence-based advocacy
- Academic writing and publication

### Neurodiversity Competency
- Understanding of various neurological conditions
- Recognition of neurodiversity as human variation
- Knowledge of accommodation strategies
- Awareness of intersectionality in neurodiversity
- Appreciation for different communication styles

### Advocacy & Communication
- Translating complex concepts for diverse audiences
- Amplifying marginalized voices
- Creating inclusive content
- Building coalitions for change
- Challenging stigma and stereotypes

## Impact on Medical Journey

Different Brains revolutionized how I think about neurological differences and medical practice. I learned that the medical model of disability - focusing on deficits and "fixing" people - often does more harm than good. The neurodiversity paradigm taught me to see neurological differences as natural variations that need support, not cures.

This experience has made me committed to:
- Providing neurodiversity-affirming healthcare
- Recognizing the expertise of patients about their own minds
- Advocating for accessibility in medical settings
- Challenging ableist assumptions in medical culture
- Considering neurodiversity in all aspects of patient care

## Research Insights

My research with Different Brains revealed critical findings:
- Employment rates for neurodiverse individuals remain unnecessarily low due to stigma, not inability
- Early acceptance and support lead to better outcomes than trying to make neurodiverse people "normal"
- Many healthcare providers lack training in neurodiversity, leading to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment
- Inclusive education benefits all students, not just those with identified differences
- Neurodiversity acceptance correlates with improved mental health outcomes

## Lessons Learned

### About Neurodiversity
- Neurological differences are part of human diversity
- Many "disabilities" are actually mismatches between individuals and environments
- Neurodiverse individuals often have unique strengths alongside challenges
- Acceptance and accommodation are more effective than normalization

### About Healthcare
- Medical providers need neurodiversity training
- Patient-centered care must include neurodiversity considerations
- Mental health and neurodevelopmental conditions often co-occur
- Healthcare accessibility goes beyond physical accommodations

### About Research & Advocacy
- Lived experience must inform research
- Academic research needs translation for real-world impact
- Advocacy without evidence is less effective
- Change requires both individual and systemic approaches

## Connection to Current Path

This experience directly influences my medical education and future practice:
- Advocating for neurodiversity training in medical curriculum
- Ensuring my future practice is neurodiversity-affirming
- Continuing research on healthcare accessibility
- Building bridges between medical and neurodiversity communities

As a physician, I will:
- Provide sensory-friendly exam rooms
- Offer multiple communication options
- Respect patient autonomy and self-knowledge
- Advocate for neurodiverse patients in healthcare systems
- Continue researching and publishing on neurodiversity in medicine

## Continuing Involvement

My commitment to neurodiversity advocacy continues:
- Ongoing research collaborations
- Medical school neurodiversity initiatives
- Mentoring neurodiverse pre-med students
- Publishing on neurodiversity and healthcare
- Building inclusive medical practices

## Reflection

Different Brains taught me that different doesn't mean less than. The organization's name itself challenges us to recognize that all brains are different - neurodiversity isn't about "us" and "them," but about recognizing the full spectrum of human cognition.

This experience showed me that as a future physician, I have a responsibility to not just treat neurodiverse patients, but to actively work toward a healthcare system that welcomes and affirms them. The combination of research and direct service taught me that systemic change requires both evidence and empathy, data and stories, science and humanity.

Every person I met through Different Brains expanded my understanding of what it means to be human. They showed me that the goal isn't to make everyone the same, but to create a world where everyone can thrive as themselves. This lesson will guide my medical practice and my life - because ultimately, celebrating different brains makes all our lives richer.
