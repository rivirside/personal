## Understanding Patient-Provider Alignment

One of the most profound observations from my time in the VA Emergency Department has been witnessing the unique dynamic when providers themselves are veterans. The shared experiences between veteran providers and patients creates a level of understanding that transcends typical clinical interactions. 

I've observed situations where patients, experiencing withdrawal symptoms, would yell at doctors and accuse them of malpractice for insisting on a full workup rather than simply treating the assumed withdrawal. The veteran providers respond with remarkable empathy and understanding - a reflection of the deep connection formed through shared military experience. This empathetic connection helps de-escalate tense situations and builds trust even in the most challenging encounters.

Through conversations with multiple members of the ED care team, both administration and providers, I've learned that this connection is something they reflect on frequently. Many explicitly acknowledge how their own veteran status enhances their ability to connect with and care for veteran patients. They understand not just the medical symptoms but the underlying experiences that shape how veterans approach healthcare.

## Impact on Identity and Medical Journey

This experience has validated my belief that shared identities between patients and providers can significantly impact healthcare delivery. When people suggest that my neurodivergent identity won't make a difference in my ability to care for patients with similar identities, I have concrete experience from the VA to validate that it can and does matter.

I'm not suggesting that providers without shared experiences cannot provide adequate care - they absolutely can. However, having shared experiences can greatly decrease obstacles to providing that care, reduce provider burnout in challenging cases, and most importantly, help patients feel safe and comfortable in approaching their care and trusting their life and wellness to their care team.

Witnessing the power of patient-provider alignment at the VA has shown me that my own experiences and identities aren't liabilities to overcome but rather assets that can enhance the care I provide to certain populations. Just as veteran providers bring unique understanding to veteran care, I can bring understanding to neurodivergent patients who often face their own barriers in healthcare.

Knowing the impact that I can have on patients - the trust I can build through shared understanding, the comfort I can provide through authentic connection, and the advocacy I can offer from lived experience - motivates me to pursue medicine. The VA has taught me that diversity in healthcare providers isn't just about representation; it's about ensuring every patient can find a provider who truly understands their journey.

## Lessons in Leadership & Service

Veterans embody service before self, and working alongside them has reinforced these values in my own life. I've learned that:
- True leadership means taking care of those under your command
- Service doesn't end with military discharge
- Resilience can be cultivated even after trauma
- Community and camaraderie are powerful healing forces

## Connection to Current Path

This experience directly influences my medical school journey and future career goals. I'm particularly interested in:
- Serving veteran populations as a physician
- Addressing healthcare disparities
- Integrating mental and physical healthcare
- Developing trauma-informed care practices
- Potentially pursuing VA healthcare career opportunities

## Continuing Commitment

My commitment to serving veterans extends beyond this volunteer experience. I plan to:
- Continue volunteering at VA facilities throughout my medical training
- Advocate for veteran healthcare needs
- Consider specialties that address common veteran health issues
- Support legislation improving veteran healthcare access
- Maintain cultural competency in military and veteran issues

## Reflection

Volunteering at the VA has been both humbling and inspiring. These men and women who've sacrificed so much deserve the best care we can provide. Their stories of service, struggle, and strength motivate me to become the kind of physician who truly serves - one who sees beyond the medical chart to the person and their story.

Every veteran I've met has taught me something about courage, whether it's the courage to face combat, the courage to seek help for invisible wounds, or the courage to keep fighting through illness. These lessons will stay with me throughout my medical career, reminding me why I chose this path of service through medicine.
