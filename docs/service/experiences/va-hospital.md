Working at the VA has provided countless meaningful moments.

These conversations have taught me about resilience, the hidden wounds of war, and the importance of truly listening.

One particular veteran taught me about the power of presence - sometimes just sitting quietly with someone who's struggling means more than any words could convey. Another showed me how humor can be a powerful coping mechanism, even in the face of serious illness.

## Impact on Medical Journey

This experience has fundamentally shaped my approach to medicine. Veterans taught me that healthcare extends far beyond treating disease - it's about honoring the whole person, their experiences, and their sacrifices. I've learned to recognize the signs of invisible wounds, the importance of building trust with patients who may be skeptical of systems, and the value of patience in care.

The VA experience has also shown me the consequences of healthcare disparities and systemic challenges. Many veterans face barriers to care including transportation, mental health stigma, and complex bureaucracy. This has reinforced my commitment to becoming a physician who advocates for patients both in and outside the exam room.

## Lessons in Leadership & Service

Veterans embody service before self, and working alongside them has reinforced these values in my own life. I've learned that:
- True leadership means taking care of those under your command
- Service doesn't end with military discharge
- Resilience can be cultivated even after trauma
- Community and camaraderie are powerful healing forces

## Connection to Current Path

This experience directly influences my medical school journey and future career goals. I'm particularly interested in:
- Serving veteran populations as a physician
- Addressing healthcare disparities
- Integrating mental and physical healthcare
- Developing trauma-informed care practices
- Potentially pursuing VA healthcare career opportunities

## Continuing Commitment

My commitment to serving veterans extends beyond this volunteer experience. I plan to:
- Continue volunteering at VA facilities throughout my medical training
- Advocate for veteran healthcare needs
- Consider specialties that address common veteran health issues
- Support legislation improving veteran healthcare access
- Maintain cultural competency in military and veteran issues

## Reflection

Volunteering at the VA has been both humbling and inspiring. These men and women who've sacrificed so much deserve the best care we can provide. Their stories of service, struggle, and strength motivate me to become the kind of physician who truly serves - one who sees beyond the medical chart to the person and their story.

Every veteran I've met has taught me something about courage, whether it's the courage to face combat, the courage to seek help for invisible wounds, or the courage to keep fighting through illness. These lessons will stay with me throughout my medical career, reminding me why I chose this path of service through medicine.
