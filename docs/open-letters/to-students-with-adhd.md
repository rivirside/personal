# To Students with ADHD

## You Belong Here

First, let me say what no one said to me when I needed to hear it: your ADHD does not disqualify you from medicine, from science, from any dream you're reaching toward. The brain that struggles to sit still through lectures is the same brain that can hyperfocus through a complex procedure. The mind that jumps between topics is the same mind that makes connections others miss.

## The Hidden Struggles

I know the exhaustion that comes not from the work itself, but from constantly adapting to systems not built for how we think. The energy spent trying to appear neurotypical, to sit still, to process information delivered in ways that don't match how we learn. The shame when you miss a deadline not because you didn't care, but because time moves differently for us.

I know what it's like to be brilliant in discussion but struggle with multiple choice exams. To understand concepts deeply but fail to show it in traditional assessments. To have professors question your commitment when really, you're working twice as hard just to stay in place.

## What I've Learned

### Systems Over Willpower
Willpower is finite, systems are sustainable. I've learned to:
- Use external structure ruthlessly (calendars, alarms, physical reminders)
- Break large tasks into absurdly small pieces
- Create artificial deadlines before real ones
- Build routines that don't require daily decision-making

### Accommodation Without Shame
Getting accommodations isn't cheating or taking shortcuts - it's leveling a playing field that was never level to begin with. Extended time on exams doesn't give us an advantage; it gives us access to show what we actually know.

### The Power of Movement
Our brains often think better in motion. I've had breakthrough insights while pacing, solved problems while walking, memorized pathways while moving. Don't fight the need to move - incorporate it.

### Medication as a Tool, Not a Crutch
If medication helps you, it's no different than glasses helping someone see. It's not about becoming someone else; it's about having access to your own capabilities. The goal isn't to be neurotypical - it's to be functional and thriving as who you are.

## The Unexpected Advantages

ADHD in medicine isn't just a challenge to overcome - it brings genuine advantages:

### Crisis Performance
When everything is urgent, we shine. Emergency medicine, acute care, high-stakes procedures - these environments that overwhelm others can feel like home to us. Our brains, always seeking stimulation, perform beautifully under pressure.

### Pattern Recognition
Our tendency to notice everything can become clinical intuition. The peripheral detail others dismiss might be the key finding. Our non-linear thinking can lead to diagnoses others miss.

### Empathy Through Struggle
Having fought to exist in systems not built for us, we understand patients who feel unheard, dismissed, or misunderstood. We know what it's like when your reality doesn't match what others expect to see.

### Innovation Through Different Thinking
Medicine needs people who think differently. Our inability to do things "the way they've always been done" can lead to innovations, improvements, better systems.

## Practical Strategies That Helped

- **Body Doubling**: Studying alongside others, even in silence, helps maintain focus
- **Pomodoro Technique**: 25-minute focused bursts with breaks honors our attention patterns
- **Multiple Modalities**: Reading, writing, speaking, drawing - engage multiple senses
- **Teaching Others**: Explaining concepts to others forces organization and reveals gaps
- **Recording Lectures**: Being able to revisit at 1.5x speed helps catch what we missed
- **Color Coding Everything**: Visual organization compensates for executive function challenges

## On Bad Days

There will be days when you feel like you're not cut out for this. When you watch classmates seem to effortlessly absorb information while you're struggling to stay present. When you wonder if everyone was right to doubt you.

On those days, remember:
- Your worth isn't measured in how easily things come to you
- Struggle doesn't mean you're in the wrong place
- Different doesn't mean less than
- You've already overcome more than most to get where you are

## Finding Your People

Seek out mentors who get it - either because they share your neurodivergence or because they've learned to value different kinds of minds. Build study groups with people who complement your strengths and weaknesses. Find clinicians who work with their ADHD rather than against it.

We exist in every specialty, at every level of medicine. We're emergency physicians thriving in chaos, surgeons hyperfocusing through long procedures, pediatricians connecting with kids who think differently, researchers making unexpected connections. You're not alone, even when it feels like it.

## A Promise

It gets better. Not because ADHD goes away, but because you learn to work with your brain instead of against it. Because you find environments that value what you bring. Because you develop systems that support you. Because you stop apologizing for being different and start recognizing it as strength.

Your ADHD is not a limitation to overcome but a different operating system to master. Medicine needs minds like ours - minds that question, that see differently, that bring energy and innovation. Don't let anyone convince you otherwise.

## Moving Forward

Take what serves you from this letter, adapt what needs adapting, ignore what doesn't fit. Your ADHD is unique to you, and your strategies will be too. The path might be longer, more winding, require more rest stops - but it's no less valid.

You belong in medicine not despite your ADHD, but with it, as part of the full package of who you are. The healthcare system needs providers who understand what it's like to not fit the mold, because so many patients don't either.

Keep going. We need you.
