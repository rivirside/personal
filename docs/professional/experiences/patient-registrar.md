## Memorable Experiences

This role taught me that healthcare begins long before the exam room. I witnessed how a compassionate scheduler could ease a nervous patient's anxiety, or how efficiently handling insurance issues could mean the difference between someone getting care or going without.

I remember an elderly patient who came in confused about her appointments - she had been scheduled with the wrong department. Instead of sending her away, I spent time calling different departments, found her correct appointment, and personally walked her to the right clinic. Her gratitude reminded me that healthcare is about serving people, not processing transactions.

Another impactful moment was helping a patient who had been trying to get an appointment for weeks. By carefully reviewing the schedule and working with providers, I found an opening that worked. When she started crying with relief, I understood how access to care isn't just about medicine - it's about dignity and being heard.

## Challenges & Learning

### Insurance Complexity
Navigating the maze of insurance requirements taught me how these systems create barriers to care. I saw patients delay necessary treatment due to authorization delays or coverage denials. This experience motivates me to advocate for healthcare accessibility as a future physician.

### Language Barriers
Working with non-English speaking patients highlighted the importance of language access in healthcare. I learned to use interpreter services effectively and picked up key medical phrases in Spanish to better assist patients.

### Emotional Labor
Being the face of the healthcare system meant absorbing patient frustrations about wait times, insurance issues, and system failures - things often beyond my control. I learned to maintain compassion while setting appropriate boundaries.

## Connection to Medical School

This experience provided crucial perspective often missing in medical education:

### Understanding the Full Patient Journey
- Seeing the obstacles patients overcome just to reach the exam room
- Appreciating how social determinants affect healthcare access
- Recognizing that medical care is one piece of overall health

### Systems Thinking
- Understanding how each role contributes to patient care
- Seeing inefficiencies that impact both patients and providers
- Appreciating the importance of care coordination

### Patient-Centered Perspective
- Learning what matters most to patients (often not what we assume)
- Understanding how small gestures make big differences
- Recognizing the importance of treating patients as whole people

## Impact on Medical Philosophy

Working as a patient registrar fundamentally shaped my approach to medicine:

1. **Access is Healthcare**: If patients can't get appointments, the best medical knowledge is useless
2. **Every Interaction Matters**: The front desk experience sets the tone for the entire visit
3. **Systems Affect Outcomes**: Administrative efficiency directly impacts clinical care
4. **Dignity in All Roles**: Every healthcare worker, regardless of position, deserves respect

## Skills Translation to Medicine

The skills I developed translate directly to physician practice:
- **Efficiency with Empathy**: Moving quickly while making patients feel heard
- **Cultural Competency**: Serving diverse populations with respect
- **Resource Navigation**: Helping patients access available services
- **Team Collaboration**: Working with all staff levels effectively

## Lessons for Future Practice

As a physician, I will:
- Respect and collaborate with all staff members
- Understand the administrative burden on patients
- Advocate for systemic improvements in access
- Remember that healthcare extends beyond clinical encounters
- Design practice workflows that prioritize both efficiency and compassion

## Reflection

Working in patient registration during summer 2022 was humbling and enlightening. It showed me healthcare from the ground up - the daily challenges of accessing care, the dedication of front-line staff, and the resilience of patients navigating complex systems.

This experience reminded me that becoming a good physician isn't just about mastering medical knowledge - it's about understanding the entire ecosystem of care. The summer I spent scheduling appointments and checking in patients taught me lessons no textbook could: that healthcare is a team effort, that small kindnesses matter enormously, and that true patient care begins the moment someone tries to make an appointment.

Every future patient I treat will benefit from my understanding of what it takes to get to that exam room. I'll never forget the view from the front desk - it's made me a more complete and compassionate future physician.
