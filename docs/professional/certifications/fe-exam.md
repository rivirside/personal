# Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Exam

## Why I'm Pursuing the FE Credential

The Fundamentals of Engineering exam represents the first milestone on the path to becoming a licensed Professional Engineer - a credential that opens doors to leadership roles in engineering, signifies verified technical competency, and enables me to take legal responsibility for engineering work that affects public safety.

My decision to pursue the FE exam stems from multiple converging interests and career goals. As someone with a diverse background spanning healthcare, technology, and aviation, I see professional engineering licensure as a way to formalize my technical capabilities and position myself for roles that require both broad knowledge and deep engineering expertise.

### Connection to Test Pilot School Aspirations
Test pilot programs, particularly those at institutions like the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School or USAF Test Pilot School, increasingly prefer candidates with engineering degrees and professional credentials. The rigorous technical analysis required in experimental flight testing demands not just piloting skills, but deep understanding of engineering principles, systems analysis, and the ability to translate complex technical data into actionable insights.

The FE exam validates my mastery of fundamental engineering concepts across multiple disciplines - exactly the kind of broad technical foundation needed for test pilot work where aircraft systems span mechanical, electrical, aerospace, and materials engineering domains.

### Innovation and Entrepreneurship Platform
My long-term vision includes developing technological innovations, particularly at the intersection of healthcare, aerospace, and human performance. Professional engineering credentials provide several crucial advantages:

- **Credibility with Investors**: PE licensure demonstrates verified technical competency when pitching engineering-focused ventures
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Many engineering projects require PE oversight for regulatory approval
- **Professional Network**: Access to engineering professional organizations and the broader PE community
- **Legal Authority**: Ability to sign off on engineering designs and take professional responsibility for technical work

### Healthcare Engineering Integration
As I pursue medical school and eventual physician training, engineering credentials create unique opportunities for biomedical engineering work. The combination of clinical knowledge and professional engineering competency positions me for roles in:

- Medical device development and regulatory approval
- Healthcare systems engineering and optimization
- Research involving technical analysis of medical interventions
- Leadership roles in healthcare organizations requiring both medical and technical expertise

## My Study Strategy

### Study Schedule and Timeline

**Phase 1: Foundation Review (Months 1-2)**
Currently working through fundamental mathematics and physics concepts, ensuring solid understanding of calculus, differential equations, and basic engineering sciences before moving to specialized topics.

**Phase 2: Engineering Disciplines (Months 3-4)**
Systematic review of each engineering discipline covered on the exam, with emphasis on areas outside my direct experience like chemical engineering principles and advanced materials science.

**Phase 3: Practice and Integration (Month 5)**
Intensive practice exam sessions, timing practice, and final review of weak areas identified through practice testing.

**Target Exam Date:** Targeting spring 2025 exam window, allowing flexibility for medical school interview season while maintaining momentum in preparation.

### Study Approach

**Problem-Solving Focus:** Since the FE exam is problem-solving intensive, I'm emphasizing working through practice problems rather than just reading theory. Each topic area includes multiple practice sessions using exam-format problems.

**Reference Handbook Mastery:** The FE exam is open-book with the provided reference handbook. I'm spending significant time learning to navigate this document efficiently, marking key formulas, and understanding how information is organized for quick access during the exam.

**Interdisciplinary Connections:** My background in medicine, aviation, and technology actually helps with many FE concepts. I'm making deliberate connections between exam material and real-world applications I've encountered, which helps with both understanding and retention.

**Timed Practice:** Regular practice under timed conditions to build comfort with the computer-based format and develop time management strategies for the 5.5-hour exam.
