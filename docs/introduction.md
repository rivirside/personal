# Introduction

Welcome to my personal documentation site. This living document serves as both a comprehensive portfolio and an active planning space, embodying a "Plan in the Open" philosophy where transparency and continuous evolution guide my professional and personal development.

## Purpose & Philosophy

This documentation serves multiple purposes:

### Planning in the Open
I believe in transparent goal-setting and public accountability. This site functions as my roadmap - documenting where I've been, where I am, and where I'm heading. By planning in the open, I create accountability for my goals while allowing others to follow my journey, learn from my experiences, and potentially collaborate on shared interests.

### Living Documentation
Rather than a static resume, this is a dynamic workspace where I continuously update my progress, reflect on experiences, and map out future endeavors. It's both retrospective and prospective - a tool for self-reflection and strategic planning.

### Resource for Others
Whether you're a colleague, potential collaborator, employer, or someone on a similar path, this documentation provides transparent insight into my capabilities, experiences, and interests. Find what you need without the traditional barriers of formal applications or networking.
