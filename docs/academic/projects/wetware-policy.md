# Wetware Policy Project

## Project Overview

A comprehensive policy framework addressing the ethical, legal, and societal implications of wetware technology and brain-computer interfaces.

## Research Objectives

- Analyze current regulatory landscape for neural interfaces
- Develop ethical guidelines for wetware implementation
- Create policy recommendations for governance frameworks
- Assess societal impact of brain-computer integration

## Background
