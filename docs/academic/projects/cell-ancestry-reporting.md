# Cell Ancestry Reporting Project

## Project Overview

A systematic review and meta-analysis investigating cell ancestry reporting practices among bioengineering journals, following up on a landmark 2019 study that explored how inadequate reporting of cell line ancestry may contribute to disparities in research outcomes for minority populations.

## Research Team

- **Principal Investigator**: Dr. Erika Moore, Department of Engineering, University of Florida
- **Role**: Research Assistant / Data Analyst
- **Duration**: [Specify dates]

## Background & Motivation

The use of cell lines in biomedical research is fundamental to our understanding of human biology and disease. However, many studies fail to report the ancestral or ethnic background of the cell lines they use, which can have significant implications:

- Genetic variations between populations can affect drug metabolism and disease progression
- Research conducted primarily on cells from European ancestry may not translate to other populations
- Lack of diversity in cell lines may contribute to healthcare disparities
- Inadequate reporting prevents researchers from assessing the generalizability of findings

This project built upon a 2019 study that first identified these reporting gaps, aiming to assess whether awareness and practices had improved in subsequent years.

## Research Objectives

1. **Quantify current reporting practices**: Determine what percentage of bioengineering papers adequately report cell line ancestry
2. **Identify trends**: Assess whether reporting has improved since the 2019 study
3. **Analyze journal policies**: Evaluate whether journal guidelines address ancestry reporting
4. **Document disparities**: Examine which populations are underrepresented in bioengineering research
5. **Propose solutions**: Develop recommendations for improving reporting standards

## Methodology

### Literature Search
- Systematic review of bioengineering journals from 2019-2022
- Focused on high-impact journals in tissue engineering, biomaterials, and regenerative medicine
- Included studies using human cell lines or primary cells

### Data Collection
- Extracted information on cell line identification
- Documented whether ancestry/ethnicity was reported
- Recorded cell line sources and suppliers
- Noted any diversity statements or limitations

### Analysis Framework
- Developed coding scheme for ancestry reporting completeness
- Created categories for reporting quality (complete, partial, absent)
- Analyzed patterns by journal, year, and research area
- Statistical analysis of trends and associations

## Key Findings

### Reporting Practices
- Found that majority of studies still failed to report cell line ancestry
- Even when commercial cell lines were used, ancestry information often omitted
- Primary cell studies showed slightly better reporting than immortalized lines
- Significant variation between journals in reporting standards

### Representation Gaps
- Overwhelming use of cells from European ancestry when reported
- Minimal representation of African, Asian, Indigenous, and Latino populations
- Critical gaps in areas like drug development and disease modeling
- Potential implications for translational research success

### Journal Policies
- Most journals lacked specific guidelines for ancestry reporting
- No standardized format for reporting this information
- Limited awareness among reviewers and editors

## Challenges Encountered

### Data Limitations
- Many older cell lines lack documented ancestry information
- Commercial suppliers often don't provide ancestry data
- Researchers may not have access to this information
- Historical samples with unknown provenance

### Methodological Challenges
- Difficulty in establishing clear reporting criteria
- Balancing thoroughness with feasibility
- Addressing sensitive topics around race and ancestry in science
- Limited precedent for this type of analysis

### Publication Challenges
The manuscript was ultimately not accepted for publication due to:
- Difficulty in establishing causality between reporting and outcomes
- Limited sample size for some comparisons
- Challenges in proposing actionable solutions
- Reviewer concerns about methodology

## Project Outcome

While the project did not result in publication, it provided valuable insights:
- Confirmed that ancestry reporting remains inadequate in bioengineering
- Highlighted the need for systemic change in research practices
- Informed future research directions for the lab
- Contributed to ongoing discussions about diversity in biomedical research

The decision to abandon the project was made after careful consideration of reviewer feedback and resource allocation, but the work contributed to the broader conversation about equity in biomedical research.

## Lessons Learned

### About Research
- Not all important research leads to publication
- Negative results and abandoned projects still provide value
- Systematic reviews require enormous time investment
- Publication bias affects what research gets disseminated

### About Health Disparities
- Disparities can be perpetuated through basic science practices
- Representation matters at every level of research
- Systemic change requires multiple approaches
- Awareness alone doesn't guarantee practice change

### About Scientific Publishing
- Peer review can be subjective and challenging
- Important topics may not fit traditional publication venues
- Persistence and adaptation are crucial
- Failed projects teach valuable lessons

## Impact on Career

This experience taught me:
- The importance of diversity and inclusion in all aspects of medicine
- How basic science practices can affect clinical outcomes
- The challenges of translating awareness into action
- The value of attempting difficult, important research questions

## Connection to Medical Practice

As a future physician, this project reinforced:
- The need to consider patient ancestry in treatment decisions
- The importance of advocating for diverse representation in research
- The recognition that medical knowledge may have inherent biases
- The responsibility to push for more inclusive research practices

## Reflection

Though this project didn't achieve its publication goals, it was far from a failure. It opened my eyes to how seemingly technical details like cell line reporting can have profound implications for health equity. The experience of working on challenging, important questions - even when they don't lead to traditional success - has prepared me for the complexities of medical practice where not every intervention succeeds but every attempt teaches us something valuable.

This work reinforced my commitment to addressing health disparities not just in clinical settings but in the fundamental research that informs medical practice. It showed me that advancing health equity requires attention to detail at every level, from the cells we study to the patients we treat.
