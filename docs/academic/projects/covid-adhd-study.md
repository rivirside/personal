# COVID-19 Impact on College Students with ADHD

## Study Title

The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health, Physical Health, and Media Use of College Students With ADHD

## Research Team

- **Organization**: Different Brains
- **Role**: Co-Lead Investigator
- **Duration**: [Specify dates during pandemic]

## Study Overview

This research project investigated how the COVID-19 pandemic and associated quarantine measures specifically affected college students with ADHD. We examined changes in mental health, physical health, academic performance, and media consumption patterns during this unprecedented disruption to normal college life.

## Background & Significance

The COVID-19 pandemic created unique challenges for college students, but those with ADHD faced particular difficulties:

### Pre-existing Challenges
- ADHD already affects executive function, time management, and self-regulation
- College students with ADHD typically rely on structure and routine
- Many depend on in-person support systems and accommodations
- Medication access and management can be complex

### Pandemic-Specific Concerns
- Remote learning removed external structure and accountability
- Social isolation affected dopamine regulation and motivation
- Increased screen time and digital distractions
- Disrupted sleep schedules and routines
- Limited access to mental health services
- Challenges obtaining ADHD medications during lockdowns

## Research Objectives

1. **Document symptom changes**: Measure how ADHD symptoms changed during quarantine
2. **Assess mental health impact**: Evaluate anxiety, depression, and stress levels
3. **Examine physical health**: Track changes in sleep, exercise, and eating patterns
4. **Analyze media consumption**: Understand how screen time and digital media use evolved
5. **Identify coping strategies**: Document what helped or hindered adaptation
6. **Compare populations**: Contrast experiences with neurotypical peers from larger study

## Methodology

### Study Design
- Cross-sectional survey with retrospective components
- Adapted questionnaires from a larger population study
- Mixed methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative data

### Participant Recruitment
- College students with documented ADHD diagnoses
- Recruited through Different Brains networks
- University disability services partnerships
- ADHD support groups and online communities

### Survey Instruments

We adapted validated questionnaires including:
- **ADHD symptom severity scales**: Measuring inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity
- **Mental health assessments**: Depression, anxiety, and stress scales
- **Sleep quality indices**: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index adaptations
- **Physical activity questionnaires**: Exercise frequency and type
- **Media use surveys**: Screen time, social media, gaming, and streaming habits
- **Academic impact measures**: GPA changes, course completion, engagement
- **Coping strategy inventories**: What helped manage symptoms

### Data Collection Process
- Online survey platform for accessibility
- Multiple reminder systems to address ADHD-related completion challenges
- Shorter survey sections to maintain attention
- Save-and-return functionality
- Optional follow-up interviews for qualitative insights

## Key Findings

### ADHD Symptom Changes
- Significant increase in inattentive symptoms during remote learning
- Hyperactivity manifested differently in home settings
- Executive function challenges intensified without external structure
- Time blindness and procrastination notably worsened
- Hyperfocus on non-academic activities increased

### Mental Health Impact
- Higher rates of anxiety compared to pre-pandemic
- Increased depression symptoms, particularly related to isolation
- Stress levels peaked during transition periods
- Rejection sensitive dysphoria intensified with reduced social contact
- Emotional dysregulation more frequent

### Physical Health Changes
- Sleep schedules became highly irregular
- Significant decrease in physical activity
- Changes in eating patterns (both over and under-eating)
- Medication adherence challenges
- Increased sedentary behavior

### Media Use Patterns
- Dramatic increase in total screen time
- Social media use as both coping mechanism and distraction
- Gaming and streaming as escape but also procrastination tool
- Difficulty with digital boundaries
- "Doom scrolling" and information overload

### Academic Impact
- Widespread difficulty with online learning platforms
- Challenges maintaining focus during virtual lectures
- Increased missing assignments and incomplete work
- GPA changes varied widely (some improved, many declined)
- Loss of academic accommodations in virtual settings

### Coping Strategies

**What Helped:**
- Maintaining some routine elements
- Body doubling through virtual study sessions
- External accountability systems
- Regular exercise when possible
- Medication adjustments with provider consultation
- Creative outlets and hobbies

**What Hindered:**
- Loss of separation between spaces
- Unlimited access to distractions
- Lack of peer interaction
- Overwhelm from self-management
- Guilt and shame spirals

## Comparison with Larger Study

When compared to the general college population study:
- ADHD students showed greater symptom severity across all domains
- More significant academic impact
- Higher baseline and pandemic-related mental health challenges
- Different patterns of media use (more extreme)
- Greater difficulty implementing standard coping strategies

## Study Limitations

- Self-reported data subject to recall bias
- Cross-sectional design limited causal inferences
- Sample may not represent all ADHD students
- Difficulty reaching most struggling students
- Pandemic timing affected data collection

## Implications & Recommendations

### For Universities
- ADHD students need enhanced support during disruptions
- Virtual accommodations require reimagining
- Proactive outreach to at-risk students essential
- Flexible policies for assignments and attendance

### For Healthcare Providers
- Increased monitoring during major transitions
- Medication adjustments may be necessary
- Telehealth can work but needs adaptation
- Address both ADHD and comorbid conditions

### For Students
- External structure remains crucial even remotely
- Peer support networks are vital
- Self-compassion during challenging times
- Seeking help early prevents crisis

## Skills Developed

### Research Skills
- Survey design and adaptation
- IRB protocol development
- Data collection with vulnerable populations
- Statistical analysis
- Scientific writing

### ADHD-Specific Knowledge
- Deep understanding of ADHD in young adults
- Awareness of pandemic's differential impact
- Insights into digital age challenges
- Appreciation for neurodiversity perspectives

### Collaboration
- Co-leading complex research project
- Working with neurodivergent team members
- Balancing multiple stakeholder needs
- Remote research coordination

## Personal Impact

As a co-lead on this project, I gained invaluable insights into:
- The lived experience of ADHD beyond clinical definitions
- How environmental changes profoundly affect neurodivergent individuals
- The importance of considering neurodiversity in public health responses
- The resilience and creativity of the ADHD community

## Connection to Medical Career

This research directly informs my approach to medicine:
- Recognition that standard interventions may not work for all
- Understanding of how ADHD affects all life aspects
- Appreciation for patient-centered, flexible care
- Commitment to neurodiversity-affirming practice

## Reflection

Co-leading this study during the pandemic was challenging but deeply meaningful. It demonstrated how crises disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, including those with ADHD. The project reinforced my belief that good research must center the experiences of those studied, not just observe from outside.

The students who participated showed incredible courage in sharing their struggles during an already difficult time. Their honesty about what wasn't working - and their creativity in finding solutions - taught me that neurodivergent individuals aren't problems to be solved but partners in creating better systems.

This research experience bridges my service work with Different Brains and my academic pursuits, showing how advocacy and research can work together to create meaningful change. As I continue in medicine, I'll carry these lessons about the importance of understanding how world events affect different minds differently.
