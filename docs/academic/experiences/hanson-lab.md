## Research Focus

Investigating enzyme lifespan and efficiency in biological systems, with applications to synthetic biology and metabolic engineering for improved biotechnology applications.

## Principal Investigator

Dr. Andrew Hanson, PhD - Plant Synthetic Biologist
Department of Horticultural Sciences
University of Florida, Gainesville, FL
Focus: Development of new continuous directed evolution methods

## Project Description

### Primary Research Project: Enzyme Lifespan Investigation
One of the major projects I was involved in investigated the lifespan of enzymes with the goal of increasing catalytic cycles until replacement - a common metric for in-vivo enzyme efficiency. We hypothesized that in vivo lifespans could be limited by collateral damage to the active site residues resulting from the enzyme's own physiological substrates and products.

This research aimed to:
- Understand how enzymes' own reactions might damage their active sites
- Identify mechanisms of collateral damage from substrates and products
- Increase the number of catalytic cycles before enzyme replacement
- Apply findings to improve enzyme efficiency in synthetic biology applications

### Research Objectives
- Characterize active site residue damage from physiological reactions
- Investigate substrate and product-mediated enzyme degradation
- Develop strategies to protect active sites from self-inflicted damage
- Enhance enzyme longevity in metabolic pathways
