# FE Exam Preparation

## Objective and Purpose

Pass the FE Exam.

Use it as a means to structure your engineering studies, and to demonstrate baseline proficiency in engineering principles for the purposes of relevant career opportunities. It provides structure to my self-directed engineering education, and  without formal engineering coursework, I need a framework to ensure I'm learning the fundamentals properly. The FE exam syllabus gives me that roadmap. It also offers objective validation of my engineering knowledge. When I apply to Test Pilot School, NASA programs, or similar opportunities, I'll need objective evidence of my STEM competency. I'll need documented proof that I can handle complex technical material. The FE certification demonstrates that I've met a national standard for engineering competency. The FE exam also opens the door to Patent Bar eligibility.


## Roadmap

### Which FE Exam?
There are multiple options for the FE exam. Of the options, the mechanical, chemical, electrical and other disciplines seem like the best options. As as base structure for engineering study, electrical would have the greatest tie in to radio skills, chemical to bio work. Other disciplines seems like the most efficient route to passing the exam, but as a structure it seems like the least interesting of the options.

Electrical Engineering would align well with my amateur radio interests and help me build deep knowledge of circuits and signals, but honestly the electrical exam would require the most intensive preparation given my background. The time investment might pull me too far from other priorities. I need to be realistic about opportunity costs. Mechanical Engineering feels like the sweet spot. It covers the broadest range of applicable topics - thermodynamics for understanding physiological systems, mechanics for aerospace applications, materials science for medical devices. The knowledge directly supports both my medical education and pilot aspirations. Other Disciplines is actually the most flexible option. It allows me to focus on core engineering principles without getting too specialized. Given that my goal is foundational knowledge rather than specialization, this might be the most efficient path.

Honestly, the other probably is the best, but cluck it we going with the MechE exam! We'll hybrid it honestly. 

### Plan

Don't bite off more than you can chew. Take it step by step. You aren't in a rush. In terms of practical utility, this goal only really becomes relevant during evaluation periods post-residency. Given that, I should aim to spread it out over several years. Baseline, two one and a half hour sessions per week. One for new content, one for broad review. Do a five AI generated questions on a topic of my choice three times a week, Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays either during my morning routine or before my bedtime routine. As free time permits, I should do additional study. During my MS3/4 gap year I can also put together a focused study time. Given this, I am aiming for taking the FE exam somewhere in the middle of residency. Use quarterly checkpoints for self-evaluation: August, November, February, May.

## Status

Calculus in high school and college, all the premed prereqs. Youtube, Khan Academy, and online question banks are the focus of my studies. Plopped a couple of complementary channels down below,  

### Reality Check

<details>
<summary>Practice Exam Performance</summary>

My first practice exam was humbling - 62% on January 15th. Dynamics and Electrical sections crushed me. By February 1st, I'd improved to 68%, but Thermodynamics and Materials are still problem areas. 

The goal is 70%+ consistently by June. That's the confidence threshold I need before sitting for the real exam.

## Next Steps

After the FE exam, the Patent Bar awaits. But that's a future problem. Right now, it's all about probability distros and therm. One equation at a time.
