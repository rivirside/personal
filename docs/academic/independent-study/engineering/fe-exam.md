# FE Exam Preparation

## Why Engineering?

The Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam opens three critical doors for my career:

1. **Patent Bar Eligibility** - Enables me to file and prosecute patents for future innovations
2. **Test Pilot School Competitiveness** - Engineering background is essential for military test pilot selection
3. **Technical Credibility** - Validates my ability to understand and work with complex technical systems

Engineering principles also directly enhance my medical education - from understanding medical devices to grasping physiological systems through fluid mechanics and thermodynamics.
